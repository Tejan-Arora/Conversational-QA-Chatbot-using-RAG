# Conversational-QA-Chatbot-using-RAG

Scraped website content using BeautifulSoup to build a custom knowledge base

Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain

Designed the chatbot to respond using only the retrieved context; if relevant information is not found, it replies with "I don't know"

Integrated conversation history management to maintain context across interactions
